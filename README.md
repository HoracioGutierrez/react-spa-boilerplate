# Simple React SPA Boilerplate

## Usage 

1. Clone the repository to a local directory     
   `> git clone https://github.com/HoracioGutierrez/react-spa-boilerplate.git`    

2. Access inside the newly created local repository    
   `> cd react-spa-boilerplate`
3. Install missing dependencies    
   `> npm install`
4. Try it out!    
   `> npm run dev`

## Final Steps    

Once you're ready to use it, you can use the `npm run build` command to get a bundle.


## Note    

Bundles are created within a dist directory. Keep in mind that the starter kit is set to compile in development mode so in order to get a production bundle you'll need to change the `MODE` variable in the `.env` file to "production"
